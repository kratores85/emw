**Released at**: `16-06-2020`

**Info**:

Fixed more bugs and updated some of the vanilla tierred armor. Please doublecheck your MCM settings from the readme.  I adjusted Ultimate Combat settings for this release to address a stagger related bug.  In previous releases I adjusted the settings without mentioning it.

## 1.0.3: Prettier Sets

**Released at**: `03-06-2020`

**Info**:

This update primarily focuses on making Enderal's unique armor sets look amazing.  Along the way
many bugs were fixed, mage balance was tweaked again, Ultimate Combat was added to help with NPC
AI and crossbows were removed.

Note on the armor sets... They are designed to be worn as a set.  Mixing and matching them may
result in visual anomalies such as wrist gaps and such.  A few of the sets have additional pieces
that are required for them to look as intended and male/female have alternate helms in many cases.  

If you are a male and go to a forge with the female helm in your inventory you can convert it to a
male helm for free one time.  Other bits and bobs that might be needed to complete your set have
similar conditions at the forge.  Any additional pieces beyond the originals give NO STATS, NO VALUE
and cannot be enchanted; they exit only to visually complete your set.

This update ***is*** save file safe if you perform a standard clean save procedure.  You may be ok
without cleaning but... who knows.
