## 2.0.4: Various Updates; Savefile Safe

Armor of Intrigue has been added as a replacer for Jespar's outfit and is not obtainable as player gear.  The outfit has been edited such that the change results in no stat changes and balance is maintained.  If you have already encountered Jespar then, in order to see the changed outfit, you will need to open the console, click Jespar and enter the `resetinventory` command. This will force him to change into the newly added outfit.

In order for the ENB update to apply you need to delete the `enbseries` folder from your skyrim se installation folder then copy everything contained within the `Game Folder files` folder into your skyrim se installation folder.

## 2.0.3: Visual Update; Savefile Safe

If you were using any of the circlets from Circlets Forged they will be gone after you update.  The mod was removed because it didn't come with blueprints and I didn't feel like making blueprints for all the newly added circlets.  This may be re-added in the future when I'm not feeling so lazy.

Mythical Rudy ENB was replaced due to issues with interior lighting.  The new ENB is better in nearly all interiors and weathers and retains support for fadetoblack and other AGCC based effects.  This will probably be the long-term ENB of choice unless a superior ENB customized for Enderal SE is released.

### Mods Added

- Faster Reanimation [1.0](33 SKELETON & ANIMATIONS)

## 2.0.2: Minor Updates; Savefile Safe

If you had anything stored in the 'Secure Chest' containers included in the newly added housing on the Sun Coast you should remove everything before you update.  Failure to do so will result in loss of the contents.

I did not notice the addition of the Secure Chest containers previously but EGO removes the vanilla ones so... removal of these just makes sense.  Additionally, without the vanilla ones in place the functionality of a Secure Chest (Cloud Storage) is basically useless.

### Mods Added

- Rally's Smithy [1.1](17 CLUTTER)

### Mods Removed

- Player Weapons Enchantment OnLoad Init Apply Fix [1.3](02 FIXES)

### Other Changes

- Removed unintentionaly added `Secure Chest` containers.

## 2.0.1: You Should Update! Fixes game breaking bug

If you were stuck at the starling locks in the cave underneath Yeero's house then update and load a save from before entering the trap door.  If you do not have a save from before entering the trap door you may need to clean the `_00e_mq02_secretleversscn` script from your save.

### Mods Removed

- Enderal Tracking Tool - Starling Lock Tweak [1.71](28 MISCELLANEOUS)

### Mods Updated

- Amnesia Shrine [3.4](11 VANILLA LOCATIONS)
- Enderal SE [2.1](00 BASE GAME)
- Spell Perk Item Distributor [4.3](34 UTILITIES)

### Other Changes

- Regenerated ALLGUD meshes

## 2.0: Welcome to the Special Edition

This release is a complete recreation of `Enderal - My Way` for the recently released `Special Edition` port of `Enderal`.  I did not keep a detailed changelog for this release but nearly everything is different except for the core gameplay overhaul EGO.

***This is obviously not savefile safe.***  Do ***not*** update if you are planning to continue playing your current character.
